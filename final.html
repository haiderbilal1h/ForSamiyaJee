Samiya, listen, please…👀♥️

I promise you, from the bottom of my heart, that I will take care of you till my last breath.🥹♥️ No matter what happens, no matter how life changes, I will always be here. When things get tough, when the world feels heavy, when you feel alone—I will be the one standing by your side. 👀♥️♥️

Whenever you need someone to hold you, a shoulder to lean on, or just someone to talk to, I will be there.👀♥️ You don’t have to go through anything alone. You will always have me, whether it’s a bad day, a silent night, or a moment when you just need to feel understood.

Samiya, you are everything I ever wanted in a girl.👀♥️ You are kind, understanding, and so pure at heart. You are a thousand times better than Musfira, Aliza, Aiman, or anyone else…🥹♥️ They don’t even come close to you. You are one in a million—a true gem.💎

In beauty?👀 Samiya wins.
In kindness?👀 Samiya wins.
In loyalty?👀 Samiya wins.
In love?👀 Samiya wins. ❤️

You are special, not just to me but in every way. You make everything feel better, even without trying. I want to talk to you about so many things—my fears, my dreams, the thoughts I keep hidden. You are the only one I feel safe enough to share them with.👀👀 I’m just waiting for the right moment, making myself ready to open up completely to you.

Because you, Samiya, are my peace, my happiness, my everything. 👀♥️

Luv you, meri jaan.♥️♥️♥️
